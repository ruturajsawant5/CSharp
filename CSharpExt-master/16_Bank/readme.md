Assume that a book maintains two kind of accounts for customers, one called savings account and the other current account. The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The current account provides cheque book facility but no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below this level , a service charge is imposed.                                                                                          Create a class Account that stores customer name, account number and type of 
account. From this derive the classes Cur-Acct and Sav-Acct to make them more specific to their requirements. Include the necessary member methods in order to accomplish the following tasks                                                                                	a. Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.                                                                                                   	B. Display the balance.                                                                                                                                                                               	C. Compute and deposit interest.                                                                                                                                                  	 D. Permit withdrawal and update the balance.                                                                                                                     	 E. Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, if necessary and update the balance.Do not use any constructor .Use member methods to initialize the class members.
